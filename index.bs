Introduction {#intro}
============

Today, user agents generally identify themselves to servers by sending a `User-Agent` HTTP request
header field along with each request (defined in Section 5.5.3 of [[RFC7231]]). Ideally, this header
would give servers the ability to perform content negotiation, sending down exactly those bits that
best represent the requested resource in a given user agent, optimizing both bandwidth and user
experience. In practice, however, this header's value exposes far more information about the user's
device than seems appropriate as a default, on the one hand, and intentionally obscures the true
user agent in order to bypass misguided server-side heuristics, on the other.

For example, a recent version of Chrome on iOS identifies itself as:

``` http
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 12_0 like Mac OS X)
              AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)
              CriOS/69.0.3497.105 Mobile/15E148 Safari/605.1
```

While a recent version of Edge identifies itself as:

``` http
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
              AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.2704.79
              Safari/537.36 Edge/18.014
```

There's quite a bit of information packed into those strings (along with a fair number of lies).
Version numbers, platform details, model information, etc. are all broadcast along with every
request, and form the basis for fingerprinting schemes of all sorts. Individual vendors have taken
stabs at altering their user agent strings, and have run into a few categories of feedback from
developers that have stymied historical approaches:

1.  Brand and version information (e.g. "Chrome 69") allows websites to work around known bugs in
    specific releases that aren't otherwise detectable. For example, implementations of Content
    Security Policy have varied wildly between vendors, and it's difficult to know what policy to
    send in an HTTP response without knowing what browser is responsible for its parsing and
    execution.

2.  Developers will often negotiate what content to send based on the user agent and platform. Some
    application frameworks, for instance, will style an application on iOS differently from the same
    application on Android in order to match each platform's aesthetic and design patterns.

3.  Similarly to #1, OS revisions and architecture can be responsible for specific bugs which can
    be worked around in website's code, and narrowly useful for things like selecting appropriate
    executables for download (32 vs 64 bit, ARM vs Intel, etc).

4.  Sophisticated developers use model/make to tailor their sites to the capabilities of the
    device (e.g. [[FacebookYearClass]]) and to pinpoint performance bugs and regressions which
    sometimes are specific to model/make.

This document proposes a mechanism which might allow user agents to be a bit more aggressive about
removing entropy from the `User-Agent` string generally by giving servers that really need some
specific details about the client the ability to opt-into receiving them. It introduces four new
Client Hints ([[I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]]) that can provide the client's branding and version
information, the underlying operating system's branding and major version, as well as details about
the underlying device. Rather than broadcasting this data to everyone, all the time, user agents can
make reasonable decisions about how to respond to given sites' requests for more granular data,
reducing the passive fingerprinting surface area exposed to the network.

Examples {#examples}
--------

A user navigates to `https://example.com/` for the first time. Their user agent sends the following
header along with the HTTP request:

``` http
  Sec-CH-UA: "Examplary Browser 73"
```

The server is interested in rendering content consistent with the user's underlying platform, and
asks for a little more information by sending an `Accept-CH` header (Section 2.2.1 of
[[I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]]) along with the initial response:

``` http
  Accept-CH: UA, Platform
```

In response, the user agent includes more detailed version information, as well as information about
the underlying platform in the next request:

``` http
  Sec-CH-UA: "Examplary Browser 73.3R8.2H.1"
  Sec-CH-Platform: "Windows 10"
```


User Agent Hints {#http-ua-hints}
================

The following sections define a number of HTTP request header fields that expose detail about a
given user agent, which servers can opt-into receiving via the Client Hints infrastructure defined
in [[I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]]. The definitions below assume that each user agent has defined
a number of properties for itself (all of which are strings):

*   <dfn for="user agent" export>brand</dfn> (for example: "cURL", "Edge", "The World's Best Web Browser")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>major version</dfn> (for example: "72", "3", or "28")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>full version</dfn> (for example: "72.0.3245.12", "3.14159", or "297.70E04154A")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>platform brand</dfn> (for example: "Windows NT", "iOS", or "AmazingOS")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>platform version</dfn> (for example: "10", "12", or "17G")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>platform architecture</dfn> (for example: "ARM64", or "ia32")
*   <dfn for="user agent" export>model</dfn> (for example: "", or "Pixel 2 XL")

User agents SHOULD keep these strings short and to the point, but servers MUST accept arbitrary
values for each, as they are all values constructed at the user agent's whim.


The 'Sec-CH-Arch' Header Field {#sec-ch-arch}
------------------------------

The <dfn http-header>`Sec-CH-Arch`</dfn> request header field gives a server information about
the architecture of the platform on which a given user agent is executing. It is a
[=Structured Header=] whose value MUST be a [=structured header/string=]
[[I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]].

The header's ABNF is:

~~~ abnf
  Sec-CH-Arch = sh-string
~~~

To <dfn abstract-op>set the `Sec-CH-Arch` header for a request</dfn>, given a [=request=] (|r|),
user agents MUST:

1.  If |r|'s [=request/client-hints set=] [=list/contains=] `Arch`, then:

    1.  Let `value` be a [=Structured Header=] object whose value is the user agent's
        [=user agent/platform architecture=].

    2.  [=header list/Set a structured header=] in |r|'s [=request/header list=] whose name is
        `Sec-CH-Arch`, and whose value is `value`.


The 'Sec-CH-Model' Header Field {#sec-ch-model}
-------------------------------

The <dfn http-header>`Sec-CH-Model`</dfn> request header field gives a server information about
the device on which a given user agent is executing. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose value MUST
be a [=structured header/string=] [[I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]].

The header's ABNF is:

``` abnf
  Sec-CH-Model = sh-string
```

To <dfn abstract-op>set the `Sec-CH-Model` header for a request</dfn>, given a [=request=] (|r|),
user agents MUST:

1.  If |r|'s [=request/client-hints set=] [=list/contains=] `Model`, then:

    1.  Let `value` be a [=Structured Header=] object whose value is the user agent's
        [=user agent/model=].

    2.  [=header list/Set a structured header=] in |r|'s [=request/header list=] whose name is
        `Sec-CH-Model`, and whose value is `value`.


The 'Sec-CH-Platform' Header Field {#sec-ch-platform}
----------------------------------

The <dfn http-header>`Sec-CH-Platform`</dfn> request header field gives a server information about
the platform on which a given user agent is executing. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose value
MUST be a [=structured header/string=] [[I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]].

The header's ABNF is:

``` abnf
  Sec-CH-Platform = sh-string
```

To <dfn abstract-op>set the `Sec-CH-Platform` header for a request</dfn>, given a [=request=] (|r|),
user agents MUST:

1.  If |r|'s [=request/client-hints set=] [=list/contains=] `Platform`, then:

    1.  Let `value` be a [=Structured Header=] object whose value is the [=string/concatenation=]
        of the user agent's [=user agent/platform brand=], a U+0020 SPACE character, and the user
        agent's [=user agent/platform version=].

    2.  [=header list/Set a structured header=] in |r|'s [=request/header list=] whose name is
        `Sec-CH-Platform`, and whose value is `value`.

The 'Sec-CH-UA' Header Field {#sec-ch-ua}
----------------------------

The <dfn http-header>`Sec-CH-UA`</dfn> request header field gives a server information about a
user agent's branding and version. It is a [=Structured Header=] whose value MUST be a
[=structured header/list=] [[I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]].

The header's ABNF is:

``` abnf
  Sec-CH-UA = sh-list
```

Unlike most Client Hints, the `Sec-CH-UA` header will be sent with all requests, whether or not the
server opted-into receiving the header via an `Accept-CH` header. Prior to an opt-in, however, it
will include only the user agent's branding information, and the major version number (both of which
are fairly clearly sniffable by "examining the structure of other headers and by testing for the
availability and semantics of the features introduced or modified between releases of a particular
browser" [[Janc2014]]).

To <dfn abstract-op>set the `Sec-CH-UA` header for a request</dfn>, given a [=request=] (|r|),
user agents MUST:

1.  Let |value| be a [=Structured Header=] object whose value is a [=structured header/list=].

2.  Let |version| be the user agent's [=user agent/full version=] if |r|'s
    [=request/client-hints set=] [=list/contains=] `UA`, and the user agent's
    [=user agent/major version=] otherwise.

3.  Let |ua| be a string whose value is the [=string/concatenation=] of the user agent's
    [=user agent/brand=], a U+0020 SPACE character, and |version|.

    ISSUE(wicg/ua-client-hints#7): Should we split the version out into a separate
    `Sec-CH-UA-Version` header? Or keep it here?

4.  [=list/Append=] |ua| to |value|.

5.  The user agent MAY execute the following steps:

    1.  [=list/Append=] additional items to |value| containing arbitrary brand and version
        combinations.

    2.  Randomize the order of the items in |value|.

    Note: See [[#grease]] for more details on why these steps might be appropriate.

6.  [=header list/Set a structured header=] in |r|'s [=request/header list=] whose name is
    `Sec-CH-UA`, and whose value is |value|.

Integration with Fetch {#fetch-integration}
----------------------

The Fetch specification should call into the following algorithm in place of the current Step 5.11
in its HTTP-network-or-cache fetch algorithm.

To <dfn abstract-op export>set the user agent metadata for a request</dfn> (|r|), the user agent MUST
execute the following steps:

1.  If |r|'s [=request/header list=] does not [=header list/contain=] `User-Agent`, then the user
    agent MAY append `User-Agent`/[=default `User-Agent` value=] to |r|'s [=request/header list=].

2.  [$Set the `Sec-CH-Arch` header for a request$], given |r|.

3.  [$Set the `Sec-CH-Model` header for a request$], given |r|.

4.  [$Set the `Sec-CH-Platform` header for a request$], given |r|.

5.  [$Set the `Sec-CH-UA` header for a request$], given |r|.


Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-privacy}
===================================

Secure Transport {#secure-transport}
----------------

Client Hints will not be delivered to non-secure endpoints (see the secure transport requirements in
Section 2.2.1 of [[I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]]). This means that user agent information will not
be leaked over plaintext channels, reducing the opportunity for network attackers to build a profile
of a given agent's behavior over time.

Delegation {#delegation}
----------

Client Hints will be delegated from top-level pages via Feature Policy (once a few patches against
Fetch and Client Hints and Feature Policy land. This reduces the likelihood that user agent
information will be delivered along with subresource requests, which reduces the potential for
passive fingerprinting. The following issues cover the dependencies:

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#773): Fetch integration of Accept-CH opt-in, and the definition of a
[=request=]'s <dfn for="request">client-hints set</dfn>.

ISSUE(whatwg/html#3774): HTML integration of Accept-CH-Lifetime and the ACHL cache

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#725): Adding new CH features to the CH list in Fetch

ISSUE(whatwg/fetch#811): 3rd-party opt-in

ISSUE(wicg/feature-policy#220): 3rd-party opt-in

ISSUE: These are all out of date. Yoav will fix them.

Access Restrictions {#access}
-------------------

The information in the Client Hints defined above reveals quite a bit of information about the user
agent and the platform/device upon which it runs. User agents ought to exercise judgement before
granting access to this information, and MAY impose restrictions above and beyond the secure
transport and delegation requirements noted above. For instance, user agents could choose to reveal
[=user agent/platform architecture=] only on requests it intends to download, giving the server the
opportunity to serve the right binary. Likewise, they could offer users control over the values
revealed to servers, or gate access on explicit user interaction via a permission prompt or via a
settings interface.

Implementation Considerations {#impl-considerations}
=============================

The 'User-Agent' Header {#user-agent}
-----------------------

User agents SHOULD deprecate the `User-Agent` header in favor of the Client Hints model described in
this document. The header, however, is likely to be impossible to remove entirely in the near-term,
as existing sites' content negotiation code will continue to require its presence (see
[[Rossi2015]] for a recent example of a new browser's struggles in this area).

One approach which might be advisable could be for each user agent to lock the value of its
`User-Agent` header, ensuring backwards compatibility by maintaining the crufty declarations of
"like Gecko" and "AppleWebKit/537.36" on into eternity. This can ratchet over time, first freezing
the version number, then shifting platform and model information to something reasonably generic in
order to reduce the fingerprint the header provides.

GREASE-like UA Strings {#grease}
----------------------

History has shown us that there are real incentives for user agents to lie about their branding
in order to thread the needle of sites' sniffing scripts. While I'm optimistic that we can reset
expectations around sniffing by freezing the thing that's sniffed-upon today, and creating a sane 
set of options for developers, it's likely that this is hopelessly naive. It's reasonable to
ponder what we should do to encourage sniffing in the right way, if we believe it's going to
happen one way or another.

User agents may choose to model `UA` as a set, rather than a single entry. This could encourage
standardized processing of the `UA` string by 
Randomly including additional, intentionally incorrect, comma-separated entries with arbitrary
ordering (similar conceptually to [[I-D.ietf-tls-grease]]) could encourage standardized processing
if the `UA` string by servers, and reduce the chance that we ossify on a few required strings.
For example, Chrome 73's `Sec-CH-UA` header might be `"Chrome 73", "NotBrowser 12"`, or
`"BrowsingIsFun Version 12b", "Chrome 73"`, or something completely different.

The 'Sec-CH-' prefix {#sec-ch}
--------------------

Based on some discussion in https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/320, it seems
reasonable to forbid access to these headers from JavaScript, and demarcate them as
browser-controlled client hints so they can be documented and included in requests without
triggering CORS preflights. A `Sec-CH-` prefix seems like a viable approach, but this bit might
shift as the broader Client Hints discussions above coalesce into something more solid that lands
in specs.

IANA Considerations {#iana}
===================

This document intends to define the `Sec-CH-Arch`, `Sec-CH-Model`, `Sec-CH-Platform`, and
`Sec-CH-UA` HTTP request header fields, and register them in the permanent message header
field registry ([[RFC3864]]).

It also intends to deprecate the `User-Agent` header field.
